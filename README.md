[Project-1:Lead Scoring_LogisticRegression](https://github.com/cuteAmi/LeadScore_logisticReg.git)

--> Goals of the Case Study
There are quite a few goals for this case study.

- Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well.

- A well-commented Jupyter note with at least the logistic regression model, the conversion predictions and evaluation metrics.
- The word document filled with solutions to all the problems.
- Mention the problem statement and the analysis approach briefly
- Explain the results in business terms
- Include visualisations and summarise it.

[Project- 2:Boom Bike_Linear_regression:](https://github.com/cuteAmi/BoomBikes_Linear.git)

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it.

1)	Business Scenario:
2)	Problem Statement
3)  Strategies:
4)  Sources:
5)  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
6) 	Rescaling the Features:
7)  Building a linear model. (using ‘Statsmodel’):
        - checking VIF
        - check VIF and p-value
        - R-square value
8)  Residual Analysis of the Train Data for the error term. (Distribution plot)
9)  Making Predictions.
10)	Model Evaluation 
11)	Final linear regression Model, which gives an appropriate idea of the dataset. (linear regression plot) 
12) Insights:

 Also tried to work with Powepoint for better summarize project and better vision.

 [Project - 3:LoanAnalysis: with Python & R- Programming Language](https://github.com/cuteAmi/LoanAnalysis_Py.git)(https://github.com/cuteAmi/LoanAnalysis_R.git)
 
 Visualize Insights and Discover Driving Features in Lending Credit Risk Model for Loan Defaults. 
 This time trying to work with Python Programming language and also with R-Programming language for Increase my knowledge.
 Single topic and work with different language gives much more clearity to sharpning and increase the skill.

 [Project - 4:Excel project: Covid, IPL< Sales](https://github.com/cuteAmi/Statistics_Excel.git)
 
 Worked with excel project.
 tried to working with advance level of excel. 
 Pivot table,Pivot Chart,spreadsheets, graphing, tables, calculations, and automation efficiently to process large quantities of data relevant to business tasks.
 
 [Project - 5: Design Thinking: Satrbucks, WalStore] (https://github.com/cuteAmi/Case-3_Starbucks.git)(https://github.com/cuteAmi/Case-4_WalStore.git)
 
 Every bussiness have some Issues, and they are alwaysb want to solve them.
 For that it is Import to understand the business.
 And for this understanding we should start with basic questions and that starts from 5W & 1H.
 We can start data analysing only when once we have all information about the Business or their management.
 So, Design Thinking part perform first role in every Data Analysis Journey.
